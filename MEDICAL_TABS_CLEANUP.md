# ‚úÖ Cleaned Up Medical Tabs - Removed Repetitive Content

## üîß CHANGES MADE

### ‚ùå Removed Repetitive Condition Names
**Problem**: Condition names appeared both in tab labels and content headings
**Fixed in**: `MedicalTabs.tsx`

**Changes Applied**:
- "About {condition.name}" ‚Üí "Overview"
- "Learn More About {condition.name}" ‚Üí "Related Articles" 
- "Understanding {condition.name} Symptoms" ‚Üí "Symptoms Guide"
- "{condition.name} Treatment Guide" ‚Üí "Treatment Guide"
- "Preventing {condition.name}" ‚Üí "Prevention Guide"

### ‚ùå Removed Static Placeholder Text
**Problem**: Static "will be available soon" messages
**Fixed in**: `MedicalTabs.tsx` and `conditions/page.tsx`

**Changes Applied**:
- Removed "Detailed overview content will be available soon"
- Removed "Detailed symptom information will be available soon" 
- Removed "Treatment information will be available soon"
- Updated to only show content when data exists from Strapi
- Removed static promotional text about "medical team working"

### üîÑ Dynamic Content Only
**Solution**: Content sections now only display when:
- Real data exists in Strapi CMS
- Related articles are available
- Or show nothing (null) instead of static placeholders

## ‚úÖ RESULT

**Clean Medical Interface**:
- Tab labels provide context (Overview, Symptoms, Treatment, Prevention)

**The medical tabs now have clean, non-repetitive headings and rely entirely on dynamic content from your Strapi backend.**
